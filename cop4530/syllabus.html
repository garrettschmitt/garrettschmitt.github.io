<h4>Textbook:</h4>
<ul>
<li><u>Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++</u>, 4th ed., 
Mark Allen Weiss, Prentice Hall, 2013
<br>ISBN: 9780132847377
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Course Description</h3>

Making efficient use of computational resources is one of the important 
tasks of any computer scientists. In this course we will explore 
different ways of organizing data to facilitate such sufficient use. 
This course covers the following topics:

<ul>

<li><b>Data structures</b>: Abstract data types (ADTs), vector, deque, 
list, queue, stack, graph, digraph, table, map (associative array), priority 
queue, set, and tree, etc.</li>

<li><b>Algorithms</b>: Algorithms are formalizations of processes that 
result in predictable and desirable outcomes. They are used in a variety of 
contexts. Particularly, data structures are made usable by implementing 
algorithms for searching, sorting, and indexing the structures. 
Algorithm design, complexity analysis and correctness proof form 
important components in study of algorithms. </li>

<li><b>Generic programming</b>: Generic programming is the science of 
component re-use. We will explore coding for re-use of both data 
structures and algorithms in C++. <i>Coding for re-use</i> and <i>re-use 
of code</i> are important aspects of software engineering.</li>

</ul>



<h3>
Course Objectives:</h3>

<ul>
The objective of the course is to teach students how to design, write, 
and analyze the performance of programs that handle structured data and 
perform more complex tasks, typical of larger software projects. 
Students should acquire skills in using generic principles for data 
representation and manipulation with a view for efficiency, 
maintainability, and code-reuse.

<p>Upon completion of the course, the student should be able to:

<li>
Define and use various common <i>abstract data types</i> (ADTs) as 
generic containers, including (but not limited to):
<ul>
 <li>Positional ADTs: vector, linked list, deque, stack, queue, graph</li>
 <li>Associative ADTs: hash table, map (associative array), priority   
     queue, set</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Demonstrate analytical comprehension of steps performed by 
algorithms that use the given data structures (sorting algorithms, tree 
navigation, etc), and of their simple variants.</li>

<li>Perform efficiency analysis on given data structures (which 
data structures allow efficient interfaces to particular forms of 
data access, such as random vs. sequential data access or 
insertion, etc).</li>

<li>Perform complexity analysis of algorithms that use the studied data 
structures</li>

<li>Effectively implement a given data structures as a <i>generic 
container</i>, using class templates with typename template 
parameters</li>

<li>Implement given algorithms using generic programming techniques 
(function templates, iterator template parameters)</li>

<li>Effectively implement these techniques in the C/C++ language</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Grading Policy:</h3>
The final course grade will be computed as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table border cellpadding="3">

<tr>
<td><tt>Programs / Assignments / Quizzes</tt></td>
<td><tt>50 %</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>Midterm</tt></td>
<td><tt>20 %</tt></td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td><tt>Final Exam</tt></td>
<td><tt>30 %</tt></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>In addition to the scale listed above, in order to earn a C- or better
in the course, course performance must satisfy the following two 
requirements.
<ul>
<li>You must earn at least 60% in both of the following components: (1) 
Programming assignment average and (2) Exam average.
 <ul>
 <li>Exam average can be computed as ((Midterm * 20) + (Final * 30)) / 50</li>
 </ul>
</li>

<li>You must obtain a grade of C- or better for certain components of 
one or two designated projects (which will be specified when we announce 
the projects). COP4530 is selected for assessment of the following 
expected outcomes for its degree programs, as required by our 
accreditation agencies, the University, and the State of Florida: (1) 
Recursive Algorithm Use and (2) Data Structure Knowledge. Departmental 
policy does not permit a final grade of C- or better to be assigned 
unless the student has at least earned a grade of C- or better on each 
of these components, regardless of performance on other work in the 
course.</li>

</ul>


<p>Graduate students taking the course under a co-listed CGS 5xxx course 
number on S/U basis must earn a B- or better for a Satisfactory (S) 
grade.

</table>

<h3>Incompletes</h3>

The grade of 'I' (Incomplete) will be assigned <b>only</b> under the 
following exceptional circumstances:

<ul>
 <li>The final exam is missed with an accepted excuse for the absence. 
In this case, the final exam must be made up within two weeks of the 
beginning of the next semester</li>

 <li>Due to an extended illness or other extraordinary circumstance, 
with appropriate documentation, the student is unable to participate in 
class for an extended period. In this case, arrangements must be made to 
make up the missed portion of the course prior to the end of the next 
semester.</li>

</ul>

Please note that "Incomplete" is <b>not</b> a 
"get-out-of-bad-grade-and-retake-the-course" card. University policy on 
Incompletes will be strictly followed.



<h3>
Tests:</h3>

There will be two tests -- a midterm and a final exam. All exams 
are in the normally scheduled classroom. On-campus students will be 
required to bring and show your Student ID on test days. The final exam 
will be cumulative. The test formats will be a mixture of short-answer, 
code reading and understanding, and code writing.&nbsp; Tentative test 
dates are listed below.&nbsp; Be aware that these may change 
slightly depending on where we are in the course materials.

<h4>

<h3>
Recitation / Quizzes</h3>
Periodic quizzes will be given, in lecture or in recitation class, to 
help students gauge their progress in the class, and to gauge 
attendance, if needed. No makeup quizzes will be given. 
Attendance and participation is expected, both in lecture and recitation 
class.  There may also be some hand-in exercises done in recitation 
class.  Any attendance grades, quiz grades, or graded work from 
recitation will count in the assignment average.

<ul><li>Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family 
and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, 
religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences 
will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students 
who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to students 
whose dependent children experience serious illness.</li>
</ul>

<br>


<h3>
Programming Assignments</h3>

<ul>
<li>Programming assignments are substantially harder than those in prior 
programming courses, and will require more time and effort to complete. 
Make sure to immediately start working on programming assignments when 
they are annnounced. Assignment specifications will be posted on the 
course web page.</li>

<li> <b>Turn in all assignments on time!</b> Late assignments
will be accepted one day after the due date, with the deduction of a
letter grade (10%). Assignments more than a day late will not be
accepted.</li>

<li><b>Compiling</b> -- Programs that do not compile are very tedious to 
grade, and they show a lack of testing, which is a large part of 
programming.  There will be an automatic 5% point penalty for each compile 
error in a student's code that has to be fixed in the grading process.  
(This means that program submissions with compile errors will likely earn 
very little, if any, credit).  Make sure your code compiles before you 
submit it!!!

</ul>


<h3>
Web References:</h3>

The course web page is your friend -- check it frequently! It will be  
continually updated with essential course materials, such as assignments,  
examples, and notes outlines. It will also include other helpful
supplements, such as instructions for using the compilers, a FAQ
(Frequently Asked Questions) page, suggested exercises, and other useful
help materials. It is your responsibility to check the web page often for
posted materials.

<br>&nbsp;

<h3>
Miscellaneous Policies:</h3>

<ol>
<li>A student will be allowed to make up a missed test if he or she has
a notice of illness from the Student Heath Center or family physician.
Any other excuses that are not medical or emergency related will be at
the discretion of the instructor, and must be approved in advance. 
If you miss a test for any reason (without advance approval), you must 
notify me of the issue within 48 hours of the missed exam </li>

<li>Students in the class should have a computer account from the Computer
Science Department (sign up for one if you don't already have one), and
this can and should be used to store project files and access one of the
compilers used in the course.</li>

<li>Please turn OFF all cellular phones, beepers, etc. in the classroom.

</ol>

<h3>
Academic Honor Policy:</h3>
     
The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the 
University&rsquo;s expectations for the integrity of students&rsquo;
academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those
expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty
members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the
Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to &ldquo; . . .
be honest and truthful and . . . [to] strive for personal and
institutional integrity at Florida State University.&rdquo; (Florida State
University Academic Honor Policy, found at <a href="
http://fda.fsu.edu/Academics/Academic-Honor-Policy">
http://fda.fsu.edu/Academics/Academic-Honor-Policy</a>.)


<p>In addition to this information, please be aware of the 
following:

<ul>
<li>Students are expected to do their <b>own</b> work on any classwork or
test submitted for a grade (unless designated as a group assignment).
 <ul>
 <li>It is understandable that discussing a problem with other 
people may lead to more insight into the issues involved. <b>While 
discussing common problems in material or encountered in assignments is 
fine, discussing or sharing solutions to the problem/assignemnt is NOT 
acceptable.</b>  Giving or receiving solutions to/from other students 
before an assignment is due and handed in (by all parties) will be 
considered a violation of the Academic Honor Code</li>

 <li>Discussing solutions and techniques on assignments with other
     students <b>after</b> the assignment has been graded and handed back 
     is okay, and encouraged.</li>

 <li>When you turn in work with your name on it, you are representing that
     work as <b>your own</b>.  If your submission matches that of
     another student, this is considered a <b>violation</b> of the
     Academic Honor Code.</li>
 </ul>

</li>

 <li>Plagiarism detection tools, such as MOSS, will be used in the 
grading process.</li>

<li>If a <b>group</b> project is given, then names of all group
     members would appear on the single program submission. This is
     appropriate</li>
     
<li>Examples found in the course textbook
may be used in programs, as long as the source is cited. This is  
appropriate, as some hand-in assignments may be based on program examples   
found in the book or contain other code that is provided to you in the
assignment specification</li>

<li>Do NOT post your assignment code solutions to publicly searchable 
web sites.  This includes online compilers/version management systems 
that may auto-post your code in a publicly searchable way. If you do, 
somebody else may copy your solutions -- and you'll be on the hook for 
providing it to them!  Use common sense!</li>
     
<li>A first violation of the honor code will result, at <b>minimum</b>
(but not limited to), a penalty of a 0 grade on the assignment
or test involved, along with a reduced letter grade in the course.</li>

<li>Any second violation of the honor code will result in an automatic F
in the course, and possible proceedings before the Honor Court.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Americans With Disabilities Act</h3>
<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should:
<br>(1) register with and provide documentation to the Student
        Disability Resource Center; and
<br>(2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the need for
        accommodation and what type. This should be done during the
        first week of class.
</p>

<p>This syllabus and other class materials are available in
alternative format upon request. </p>
